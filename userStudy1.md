##Feedback from first user study:
1. Color of the nodes should be decided by the user
2. Time: instead of being unlabelled, we should label it with each commit id or commit date on the time axis
3. User should be able to determine a time scale. So the user should be able to collapse/merge and display several commits in a group. My interpretation for this is that for large repo with like over 5000 commits, we may want to just see the changes over time for every 50 or 100 or 1000 commits instead of seeing every commits
